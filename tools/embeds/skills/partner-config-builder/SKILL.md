## Source-of-truth files to read first
Usually include:
- JULES.md

- jules.style.md
- jules.qa.md
- tools/jules/jules-copy-rules.md
- embeds/EMBED-README.md when present
- embeds/partner-config.js when present
- embeds/partners.json when present

## Process
1. Structure JSON/JS config object.
2. Populate with default demo data.
3. Clearly label demo data.

## Output requirements

Requirements:
- Include default partner config.
- Example partner data must be clearly example/demo.
- Do not imply real partner access.
- Include:
  - name
  - ref
  - ctaLabel

## Safety and partner-claims rules
Do not invent or imply:
- Fake partner relationships
- Fake affiliate relationships

- Fake ratings
- Fake revenue numbers
- Fake conversion rates
- Fake compliance claims
- Fake guarantees
- Fake integrations
- Official platform approval unless explicitly documented

Include embed safety disclaimer: For planning support only. Sensitive business decisions need qualified human review. This is not legal, financial, tax, HR, lending, accounting, medical, underwriting, or compliance advice.

## Accessibility and responsive rules
- Use the project’s neobrutalist + futurist fintech + cyberpunk style (Ink black, Off-white cards, Acid lime, Cyber pink, Electric cyan, Signal orange, Violet accents, Thick borders, Hard offset shadows, Monospace labels, Compact dashboard panels, Readiness scorecard motifs, High contrast).
- Ensure keyboard navigation, visible focus states, button/link labels, sufficient contrast, correct heading order, and reduced motion constraints.
- Comply with responsive limits: Max full embed size 940px wide by 1200px tall. Compact size constraints applied correctly.

## QA checklist
- [ ] Required source files read?

- Failing to bounds-check embed sizing.
- Missing explicit safety disclaimers.
- Introducing open redirects via referral parameter handling.
