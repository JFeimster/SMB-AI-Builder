# embed-responsive-qa

## Purpose
Check embed responsiveness.

## When to use this skill
- When testing embeds across different viewport constraints.

## When not to use this skill
- When checking backend data.

## Inputs Jules should collect
- Embed files and specified target dimensions.

## Files and folders this skill may touch
- Analyzes all CSS/HTML files in `embeds/`.

## Source-of-truth files to read first
Usually include:
- JULES.md
- jules.json
- jules.style.md
- jules.qa.md
- tools/jules/jules-copy-rules.md
- embeds/EMBED-README.md when present
- embeds/partner-config.js when present
- embeds/partners.json when present

## Process
1. Test full width (940px) and max height (1200px).
2. Test compact width (420px) and mobile width.
3. Verify overflow handling (no horizontal scroll).

## Output requirements
- Responsive compliance validation.
Include:
- 940px full width.
- 1200px max height.
- 420px compact width.
- Mobile width.
- Overflow behavior.
- No horizontal scroll unless intentionally bounded.
- Host-page safe sizing.

## Safety and partner-claims rules
Do not invent or imply:
- Fake partner relationships
- Fake affiliate relationships
- Fake endorsements
- Fake testimonials
- Fake reviews
- Fake ratings
- Fake revenue numbers
- Fake conversion rates
- Fake compliance claims
- Fake guarantees
- Fake integrations
- Official platform approval unless explicitly documented

Include embed safety disclaimer: For planning support only. Sensitive business decisions need qualified human review. This is not legal, financial, tax, HR, lending, accounting, medical, underwriting, or compliance advice.

## Accessibility and responsive rules
- Use the project’s neobrutalist + futurist fintech + cyberpunk style (Ink black, Off-white cards, Acid lime, Cyber pink, Electric cyan, Signal orange, Violet accents, Thick borders, Hard offset shadows, Monospace labels, Compact dashboard panels, Readiness scorecard motifs, High contrast).
- Ensure keyboard navigation, visible focus states, button/link labels, sufficient contrast, correct heading order, and reduced motion constraints.
- Comply with responsive limits: Max full embed size 940px wide by 1200px tall. Compact size constraints applied correctly.

## QA checklist
- [ ] Required source files read?
- [ ] Requirements for this specific embed skill met?
- [ ] Partner-claims rules followed?
- [ ] Accessibility and responsive rules verified?
- [ ] Disclaimer language included appropriately?

## Common mistakes to avoid
- Duplicating the full landing page content in the embed.
- Introducing external frameworks (use standalone HTML/CSS/JS).
- Failing to bounds-check embed sizing.
- Missing explicit safety disclaimers.
- Introducing open redirects via referral parameter handling.

## Final response format
Return a concise summary with:
1. Files created or updated.
2. Any existing files that were expanded.
3. Any assumptions made.
4. Any files that could not be created or verified.
5. Confirmation that the expanded Embeds skills library now exists under `tools/embeds/skills/`.
